## A Generic Promise implementation for TypeScript

Promises are used to structure asynchronous programs and to avoid callback hell. While they are not as full featured like [Rx](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) for example, they are attractive because their implementation is rather simple.

### Installing Promise.ts

Assuming that you are using Visual Studio, have [TypeScript 1.0rc](http://www.typescriptlang.org) installed:

- [install the nuget package](http://nuget.org/packages/Promise.TypeScript/).

- Then refer the Promise.ts file like:

		/// <reference path="Scripts/Promise.ts"/>

- and to your module:

		export var defer = P.defer;
		export var when = P.when;
		export interface Promise<Value> extends P.Promise<Value> {}

### Using Promise.ts

#### Creating Functions that return Promises

The pattern for creating promises is as follows: First a "deferred" is created that represent a precursor to a promise, then the deferred is bound to the callbacks, and then it returns the promise which may then be composed by the caller.

For example:
	
	function readBlob(blob: Blob): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
	{
		var d = defer<ArrayBuffer>();

		var reader = new FileReader();

		reader.onerror = (err) => d.reject(err);
		reader.onabort = () => {
			d.reject({ message: "aborted" });
		}
		reader.onloadend = () => {
			d.resolve(reader.result);
		}

		reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);

		return d.promise();
	}

The function above starts the reading operation and returns a promise that represents the the future result.

#### Composing Promises

The promise returned by `readBlob()` can now be composed with other functions that return promises:

	readBlob(blob).then(bytes => writeFile("name", bytes));

`then` also accepts regular values which act like an already resolved promise, for example

	readBlob(blob).then(bytes => bytes.reverse());

returns a promise that represents the read operation of the block and the reversing of its binary content. The returned promise gets resolved as soon the conversion function finishes.

Starting parallel processes is also straight forward:

	var blobReader = readBlob(blob);
	var f1 = blobReader.then(bytes => writeFile("name", bytes));
	var f2 = blobReader.then(bytes => writeFile("name2", bytes));

Would then write the received bytes to the file "name" and "name2" at the same time.

Note that it is also possible to retrieve the result directly from the `blobReader` instance:

	var f1 = blobReader.then(() => writeFile("name1", blobReader.result));
	
.. which may simplify complex composition scenarios.

And when we need to join the results together, the `when` combinator takes a number of promises and returns one that resolves when all its arguments are resolved:

	when(f1, f2).then(() => commitToDatabaseThatAllFilesAreWritten());

Note that the returning type of `when` is `Promise<any[]>`, which resolves to an array that contains the results `when` was waiting for.

#### Adding Handlers

In addition to the composition features, there are low level primitive functions that can be used to register certain handlers:

	p.done(value => {});

registers a handler that is called when the promise is resolved.

	p.fail(err => {});

registers a handler that is called when the promise is rejected.

	p.always((value?, err?) => {});

registers a handler that is called when either the promise is resolved or rejected.

When multiple handlers of the same kind are registered, they are called in their registration order.

### Ideas

- An explicit parallel combinator.
- Instead of `any[]`, use Tuples for the return type of `when()`. Because TypeScript does not have a standard library, someone needs to create `Tuple<>` types. BTW: What about creating a standard library that can be distributed as a number of nuget packages similar to the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) repository? 
- Some looping or recursing construct that avoids eating stack space. The [recur special form](http://clojure.org/special_forms#recur) in Clojure looks like a good idea to start from.
- Progress notifications anyone?
- Exception handling.

### Design & Implementation Details

I've decided to make it a bit harder to compose deferreds by not adding the composition methods to the `Deferred<Value>` interface. This makes the implementation simpler and has the additional advantage that implementors need to think and explicitly call `promise()` before they can start composing.

I've decided against all exception handling for now, because I have never used promises before and don't know what exactly programmers would expect. Obviously this might change for a future version.
